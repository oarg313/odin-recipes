    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Let's dive into the art of homemade pizza! It may seem like a lot of work, but the results promise a delicious meal and the satisfaction of mastering a kitchen staple. With just a handful of ingredients and a bit of patience for rising and resting, you'll soon be on your way to creating a pizza crust that's crispy on the outside and delightfully chewy on the inside.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <ul>
        <li> 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed </li>
        <li> 2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
     </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans. </li>
            <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms. </li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.) </li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans. </li>
            <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking. </li>
            
        </ol>
