    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version, and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.</li>
            <li>Onion – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
            <li>Red wine – This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
            <li>Marinara sauce – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
            <li>Dried thyme – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
            <li>Sugar – balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
            <li>Parsley – flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles – Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
            <li>Cottage cheese – adds great texture and moisture.</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese – we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese – An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
            <li>Egg – helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep – Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente, then drain and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Assemble – Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Bake – Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Rest – Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
